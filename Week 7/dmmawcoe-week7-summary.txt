On Tuesday we had the mid-term.
On Thursday we talked about:
-More CSS elements and how we could use them in a page.
-Started doing the homework due the 13th for the rest of class.
-I was curious (as I just read comments about the wireframes) as to different nav types other than carousels you would recommend?
