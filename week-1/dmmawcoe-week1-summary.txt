In class on Thursday we talked about:

-The current state of the internet (current websites over 1.2 billion) and the creation of the internet (as we know it buy Tim Berner-Lee at CERN in 1989)

-﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿How the internet was created with the intent to be a communication line if all else failed during the Cold War

-The difference between browsers and how they were similar to a cars engine

-Servers and how they handle traffic requests

-What requests needed to have to be handled by the server--and what it would respond with (2xx success, 3xx redirection, 4xx client error, 5xx server error)

-The different components of the internet and compared those to real world jobs that people could more easily recognize (URL, protocolm, host name/IP, port, TLD, sub domain)

-IP addressed and packet rooting

-My question for the midterm: What are different kinds of browsers--and how do they interact with the internet
