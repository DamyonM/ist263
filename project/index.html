        <p>This is me! I am a sophomore at Syracuse University studying at the iSchool and minoring in Computer Engineering. Growing up my parents exposed me to a lot of good films--especially older ones and since then I have always loved watching movies of every genre (good or bad) and giving my two cents on them to anyone who will listen. The input I give can range anywhere from who was good and bad cast-wise, if the plot was bad, if there was too many ex-machinas, or sometimes even just about the soundtracks (if you are looking for a show with a good soundtrack, and an even better plot I implore you to check out Umbrella Academy on Netflix--strong 8.5/10 show). Please enjoy the website! I would love to hear comments on what I have--if you agree or disagree and why! Also, The cutie on my left is my dog Lily, and the other on my right is Lucy Lou, both are King Charles Cavaliers.</p>
